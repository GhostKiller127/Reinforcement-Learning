sequential observations
    learner
        targets use longer input length then trained loss
        episode boundaries are crossed for loss and actor
additional capabilities
    multiple runs at once
    gymnasium play and show
    crypto environment
        add profit state to each kline
evaluation
    predicted mean, max or distribution of value head
optimizations
    bandit vectorization, need to use jax vmap
    maybe
        initialize optimizer only for learner, copy only parameters
        ram usage
        float32
        jax everything
terminal messages
    Segmentation fault
runs
    establish baseline run, or check hyperparameters better
