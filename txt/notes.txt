sequential observations
    learner
        targets use longer input length then trained loss
additional capabilities
    check jax saving and loading
    s5 model
    sequential observations
    gymnasium play and show
    crypto environment
        add profit state to each kline
evaluation
    predicted mean, max or distribution of value head
optimizations
    bandit vectorization, need to use jax vmap
    use jax environments
    smaller dataloader
    initialize optimizer only for learner, copy only parameters
    ram usage
    float32
    jax everything?
terminal messages

runs
    establish baseline run, or check hyperparameters better
