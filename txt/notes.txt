transformer
    can I predict for multiple obs in one pass?
        actor: no
        learner from memory: yes!
            crypto: add profit state to each kline
    set min_sequence_length
    environment?
        use architecture parameter
        pass obs as sequence with past of maximally min_sequence_length, not seperately
    data collector
        also pass obs as sequences
    actor
        repeat first obs to fill min_sequence_length
    learner and/or data collector
        add min_sequence_length - 1 times the first obs at the beginning of the sequence for gym
        forward pass and train on whole sequence
additional capabilities
    gymnasium play and show
    training with jax
    s5 model
    crypto environment
evaluation
    laserhockey env, train and val mode
        rewards
        episode length
    number of validation environments should be percentage based
    predicted mean, max value or distribution
optimizations
    refactoring
    find ram accumulation
        run in loop
            data collector saving
            laserhockey environment
            bandits
    find bottleneck
        measure and print time for each complete run step
        measure time for subsequent tasks
        print as list/dict with times and percentages
            bandit
            data collector
            model and optimizer state
            hyperparameters
        can I run regular tasks like saving and loading on a side core?
            maybe main script launches side script
            will there the accessing problems?
                if yes, main script is on ram, side script on hdd
