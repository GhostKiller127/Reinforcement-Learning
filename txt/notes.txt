    add transformer
        can I predict for multiple obs in one pass?
            actor: no
            learner from memory: yes!
                crypto: add profit state to each kline
        set min_sequence_length
        environment?
            use architecture parameter
            pass obs as sequence with past of maximally min_sequence_length, not seperately
        data collector
            also pass obs as sequences
        actor
            repeat first obs to fill min_sequence_length
        learner and/or data collector
            add min_sequence_length - 1 times the first obs at the beginning of the sequence for gym
            forward pass and train on whole sequence
    optimize code
        how come some gpu memory is given back after execution, and some not?
        bandit: little overhead for complicated environments
    read saved papers
    add playing against agents
