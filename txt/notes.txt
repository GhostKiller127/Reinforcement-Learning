sequential observations
    learner
        targets use longer input length then trained loss
        episode boundaries are crossed for loss and actor
additional capabilities
    gymnasium play and show
    crypto environment
        add profit state to each kline
evaluation
    predicted mean, max or distribution of value head
optimizations
    target scaling
    better/correct seeding
    initialize optimizer only for learner, copy only parameters
    ram usage
    float32
    jax everything
terminal messages
    Segmentation fault
    probabilities containing NaN
hyperparameters
    lower bootstrap length
    lower d_target
    lr finder
    test scalings
