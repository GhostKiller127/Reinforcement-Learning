ssm
    model
        float64 vs float32
    can I predict for multiple obs in one pass?
        actor: no
        learner from memory: yes!
            crypto: add profit state to each kline
    set min_sequence_length
    environment?
        use architecture parameter
        pass obs as sequence with past of maximally min_sequence_length, not seperately
    data collector
        also pass obs as sequences
    actor
        repeat first obs to fill min_sequence_length
    learner and/or data collector
        add min_sequence_length - 1 times the first obs at the beginning of the sequence for gym
        forward pass and train on whole sequence
additional capabilities
    gymnasium play and show
    training with jax
    s5 model
    crypto environment
evaluation
    predicted mean, max or distribution of value head
optimizations
    bandit vectorization
    ram: maybe needed later
