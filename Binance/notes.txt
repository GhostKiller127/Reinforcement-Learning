maybe todo:
- correct position encoding
- add option to continue training
- lin vs asinh label preprocessing
- different number of labels
- add deviation prediction to estimate accuracy
- different thresholds for sell and buy
- different rewards for profit and loss
- maybe add prediction evaluation (prediction mean & std) -> easier to find thresholds
- maybe add percentage threshold for better comparison
- check prediction distribution for max threshold for real data
- train autoencoder to precompute features for faster rl (comma, 2048 features, can use big model)

future todo:
- train world-model for search
- gather all trading data for:
	- see effect of ones own action, if trading with large amounts, to correct world-model
	
todo:
- trade for one week, gather all data, and check with offline data & performance (binance data vs bybit trading) (retrieve past trading data)
- get rid of indicators
- add all necessary state information (coin, size, profit) (special token design)
- check if using all coins is efficient
- add test split (train, val, test)
- check first day of history for anomaly
- use all history
