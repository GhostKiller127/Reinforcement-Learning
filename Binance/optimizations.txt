optimizations:
- correct position encoding
- add option to continue training
- check first day of history for anomaly
- lin vs asinh label preprocessing
- different number of labels
- add deviation prediction to estimate accuracy
- different thresholds for sell and buy
- different rewards for profit and loss
- maybe add prediction evaluation (prediction mean & std) -> easier to find thresholds
- maybe add percentage threshold for better comparison
- check prediction distribution for max threshold for real data
