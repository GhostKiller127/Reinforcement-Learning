training plots:
combined loss (1,2)
V-loss (1,2)
Q-loss (1,2)
Ï€-loss (1,2)
average performance (real or not?)

validation plots:
index evaluation average 
bandits average evaluation performance
[argmax performance (1,2,1+2)]

use old code to generate newer one
use old versions to merge with specified functionalities

structure:
config file (parameters for environments)
[parameter server] (is just saved weights on ssd)
[data collector] (implement temporary data)
[architectures]
actor class
    load architecture according to config
    load_weights function
    get_action function (CASA & use bandit_values)
learner class
[bandit class]
algorithm/training class
models
runs
