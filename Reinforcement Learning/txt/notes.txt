    environment
        merge gymnasium play, testing, evaluation & training
    optimizations
        add transformer
            can I predict for multiple obs in one pass?
                actor: no
                learner from memory: yes!
                    crypto: add profit state to each kline
            actor
                repeat first obs to fill the sequence length
            learner and/or data collector
                add sequence - 1 times the first obs at the beginning of the sequence for gym
                forward pass and train on whole sequence
        look at agent57 and other deepmind papers
        read r2d2 ff vs deep, impala
        target network

plots
    save data plots on file in plots folder, because tensorboard files get too big and too slow to load
    add index weight and count distribution as image
    if saving takes long, save every 50.000 frames

        doubled r2 to 0.8, maybe larger discount needed
        rerun: doubled r2 to 0.8, per
        increase discount factor to .995 then .997
